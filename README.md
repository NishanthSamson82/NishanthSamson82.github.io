## Link to the portfolio website: www.nishanthsamson.me
## I have created a simple portfolio website using the Github student developer pack benefits (namecheap and canva) to showcase my skills and accomplishments.
## I designed the website using Figma and google sites and deployed it on a namecheap domain via GitHub. 
## It contains four sections:
- Education
- Experience
- Projects 
- About me
## I have added a link to the portfolio website on my profile as well as here in this readme file
Do check it out :)
